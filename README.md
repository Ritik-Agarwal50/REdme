## Job Board

Let me introduce you all to the fantastic website called Job Board. Usually, what we do we apply for jobs on the Web2 website which I don't like To be honest, we all decided to create our own website for job boarding on Web3. This was a roller-coaster journey for us. we faced a lot of back-breaking problems. The major task for us is of **Bounties** we never worked for bounties but this time we are doing it. We targeted 3-4 bounties in a single shot and we manage to figure out how to implement it.

## Hurdles We faced during this project

We Took so much time to figure out the project is waste a lot of our time. The major problem was nobody was familiar with ** Api Fetching** We try to do it through reading Documentation and testing the other function we fail to do it in the begging at the end we asked for help from other people
