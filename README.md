## Hurdles We faced during this project

This was a roller-coaster journey for us. we faced a lot of back-breaking problems.The major task for us is of **Bounties** we never worked for bounties but this time we are doing it. We targeted 3-4 bounties in a single shot and we manage to figure out how to implement it.
One of the problems was **Api Fetching** We try to do it by reading Documentation and testing the other function.
While we targeting there were a Few technologies we never heard of we communicate with other people and read the docs to Figure it out.In the Smart contract also we face difficulties because it was not working the way we want. After asking help from few people we figure out the issue and fixed it.
While working with the front end we faced **Hydration** error in Next.js. Which was there till Last day.
